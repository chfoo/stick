======

This directory is for testing whether building with HXCPP and Hashlink works. It is useful for sanity testing an environment to troubleshoot building errors. There is no automated binding generation involved here.

To build and run on Linux:

    haxe main.cpp.hxml
    haxe main.hl.hxml

    ./run.cpp.sh
    ./run.hl.sh
